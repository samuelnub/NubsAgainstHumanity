    Apparently you need "span" and "centred" classes in your element (within each row)
    for the centering to work

9 Jan 2017
    What am I? some sort of idiot? (yea), well, I just needed a custom .centred class.
    I'm sorry CSS gods, I guess I haven't sacrificed enough divs.

    Fancy menu thing that slides up and asks you if you want to confirm your poor choice.
    Bit buggy, if it stops working, just spam click it a bit.

    const rect = e.target.getBoundingClientRect();
    const offsetX = e.clientX - rect.left;
    const offsetY = e.clientY - rect.top;
    console.log(offsetX + ", " + offsetY);
    If you ever want to get the element-relative coords of your click event.
    There's now a debug logger to the renderer screen, in case you want to let your
    people know that you're a terrible "programmer"

    trying to make the intro screen. Also trying to fix up the "sanitize string" function.
    I'm liking these animations. it hides the fact that I'm a bad "programmer"
    Use media queries for the main screen's styling.

    mucking around with peerjs and its server counterpart

16 Jan 2017
    use stun and turn servers,

    peerjs moved to simple-peer. I'm a simple man. Go away.
    don't know if the electron version of chrome also forbids webrtc from non-ssl pages.
    if it does forbid, I might need to use the node implementation of wrtc...

    if I want to add twitter support, try using PIN authentication, instead of OAuth,
    as OAuth needs a callback URL, which I'm too poor to afford.
    https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/pin-based
    gonna use WRTC from the browser instead of the 3rd party node implementation
    it's a bit slow in making the session desc, don't know why.
    sdp reduction done by https://github.com/fippo/minimal-webrtc
    you can also close prompts now, like a real conformist.

27 Jan 2017
    the sdp reducer was giving a bit of troubles (or I'm just bad at using it),
    so for now it's just pure stringy signal data
    OOH YES. You don't need to serve your page over https to use wrtc in electron.

    twit, passport and passport-twitter dependencies now.
    
29 Jan 2017
    screw passport, going to try something else.

    oauth works lol, followed 
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12873463/how-to-send-the-oauth-request-in-node
    now i just need to know how to store the consumer keys. shite.
    so - there isn't any way of fully obfuscating it. just making it tougher for the end 
    user to easily get. if anyone's motivated enough to get it from the eventual packaged 
    source, congrats.

    meh, some stuff, oh yea, and if you try to get an access key with a request token that
    hasn't been authorised yet, it'll invalidate it and make it all messed up. jic

    hey look its february, hell yea
    aw yes, signing in works lol, also fixed the prompt not disappearing when submitting
    a popup menu that looks pretty clean
    also, media queries
    by the way, outerHTML will get the element's html as a string too!
    font awesome addition, gotta say, it's pretty awesome
    
2 Feb 2017
    a pretty slick navigation bar (that's its official name, TIL) also,
    TODO: please, for the love of god, don't do file I/O operations in your browser
    page. If you accidentally clear the document, you're beyond screwed. Load up all needed
    stuff in the main process first.

3 Feb 2017
    TODO: make the "submit" and "cancel" buttons; uh, actual button elements, not divs.
    when working with the nav bar as well as the popup menus, use the > inner div
    set up the twit client and the twit stream too. add your own listeners to the stream
    when you need it.

    february: the month that big O became a huge O
    some stupid array helpers
    also getting the twitter profiles when making a new game
    and also local images
    by the way, the myPeers array should look like:
    myPeers = [
        {
            profile: { // main profile attained later, when already connected. it's redundant sending it in the DM
                uuid: "...",
                nickname: "doofus",
                twitterHandle: "do_ofus",
                ...
            },
            twitterHandle: "do_ofus", // temporary, initially obtained
            twitterProfilePicUrl: "http://dickCheney.com/weh.png", // just to save on API calls
            connected: false,
            peer: new Peer(),
            ...
        },
        {
            ...
        },
        ...
    ];

    oh yea, tell the user somewhere that "yea, it's hip and cool to spam twitter calls, but
    guess whose ass is gonna get throttled at the end of the day? yea, you"
    TODO: reduce the search calls in addTwitterHandleToList(), it's really bogging me down
    if you spam the same twitter handle in that func, you may get visual dupes, but don't 
    worry man, they aren't real.
    a bit of cleanup too
    
6 Feb 2017
    TODO: more exception catching and handling please, thanks
    DM's

7 Feb 2017
    removed sdp reduce functions, sadly :(
    
8 Feb 2017
    for now, it'll be a star topology, if i eventually shake off my laziness, it might 
    automatically attempt to makek a full mesh with every other peer in the game
    we'll see how bad the star topology works, though i'd need more people to test it with
    ...which i'm going to have a hard time doing
    also capped the nicknames' max char length
    working on stream listeners for game joining

9 Feb 2017
    just finished up the sending and receiving of stuff, need to test and see if it actually
    works lol. 
    hell yea, fixed it, turned out that the undefined error was because the stream also
    picks up on our sent DMs lol
    i'm relieved
