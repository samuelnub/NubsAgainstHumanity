    Apparently you need "span" and "centred" classes in your element (within each row)
    for the centering to work

    What am I? some sort of idiot? (yea), well, I just needed a custom .centred class.
    I'm sorry CSS gods, I guess I haven't sacrificed enough divs.

    Fancy menu thing that slides up and asks you if you want to confirm your poor choice.
    Bit buggy, if it stops working, just spam click it a bit.

    const rect = e.target.getBoundingClientRect();
    const offsetX = e.clientX - rect.left;
    const offsetY = e.clientY - rect.top;
    console.log(offsetX + ", " + offsetY);
    If you ever want to get the element-relative coords of your click event.
    There's now a debug logger to the renderer screen, in case you want to let your
    people know that you're a terrible "programmer"

    trying to make the intro screen. Also trying to fix up the "sanitize string" function.
    I'm liking these animations. it hides the fact that I'm a bad "programmer"
    Use media queries for the main screen's styling.

    peerjs moved to simple-peer. I'm a simple man. Go away.
    don't know if the electron version of chrome also forbids webrtc from non-ssl pages.
    if it does forbid, I might need to use the node implementation of wrtc...

    if I want to add twitter support, try using PIN authentication, instead of OAuth,
    as OAuth needs a callback URL, which I'm too poor to afford.
    https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/pin-based
    gonna use WRTC from the browser instead of the 3rd party node implementation
    it's a bit slow in making the session desc, don't know why.
    sdp reduction done by https://github.com/fippo/minimal-webrtc
    you can also close prompts now, like a real conformist.

27 Jan 2017
    the sdp reducer was giving a bit of troubles (or I'm just bad at using it),
    so for now it's just pure stringy signal data
    OOH YES. You don't need to serve your page over https to use wrtc in electron.

    twit, passport and passport-twitter dependencies now.

    screw passport, going to try something else.
